# 🧠 Jarvis - Your Personal AI Assistant

This is a Python-based AI assistant inspired by *Iron-Man Jarvis*, capable of:

- 🔍 Searching the web  
- 🌤️ Weather checking
- 📨 Sending Emails 
- 📷 Vision through camera (Web app
- 🗣️ Speech
- 📝 Chat (Web app) 

This agent uses LiveKit that is 100% free however you will need to get API keys for LiveKit and Gemini.
API keys should be uploaded into a .evn file which I have ignored to add in the github.
